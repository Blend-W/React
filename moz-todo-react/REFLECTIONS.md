## What I enjoy
    So far I really enjoy how much you can break up specific components and just copy and paste them into your app.jsx file, I noticed too when you add a function but don't change the state it just logs what the user had done with the event but still need to add the function

## Problems
I had a really problem with identifying where functions were supposed to be. for example I was putting the addList outside of my app function not realizing it kept making my local host look blank and realized everything needs to be in the app function because that is where the app is.

## Entertainment
A horse walks into a bar.
Several of the patrons quickly get up and leave, realizing the potential danger in the situation.
