## Why I Chose React
Honestly it is mainly the only SPA I am familiar with
this past summer I worked with an intern to make a front-end ui that was able to gather data from this mock backend server with static values inside it. 
main goal was just to see if our i could get this information and display it, we also had to be sure we could also add new information into the backend.
I didn't do too much, mainly just made a css file for a classification banner, what I focused on was making a stress tester for the actual backend server to see how many requests we could make before it broke.
## Problems
Main difficulty was trying to get npm to download right, nothing too bad. One problem I did have was when it was teaching about props and const variables that can hold values and you can reference them inside your app.jsx, I added those but i was also on the step where you go into the main.jsx file and add the subject="clarice" it just makes the whole page blank but I realized they were different instructions.
